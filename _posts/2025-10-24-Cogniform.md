# CogniForm

CogniForm is an interactive cognitive science survey platform designed to assess various cognitive traits through tasks such as the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and Delay Discounting Task. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for participants to complete surveys and view their results, while also offering tools for researchers to analyze and visualize collected data.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Cognitive Tasks**: Includes tasks like CRT and Delay Discounting to assess cognitive traits.
- **Demographics Collection**: Collects participant demographics such as age, education, and familiarity with cognitive science.
- **Real-Time Results**: Displays individual results immediately after task completion.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Provides aggregated analysis and visualizations of participant data.
- **Database Integration**: Stores participant responses in a database for further analysis.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Easily deployable using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
