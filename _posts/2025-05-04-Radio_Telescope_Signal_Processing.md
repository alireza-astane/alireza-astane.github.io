# Signal Processing for Radio Telescope Project

This project, completed under the supervision of Dr. Reza Rezaee at Sharif University of Technology, simulates a real-time signal processing pipeline for multiple radio telescopes. The system:
- Accepts real-time data streams from telescopes.
- Calculates phase differences between signals.
- Tunes and overlaps the signals.
- Computes the Fourier transform to generate a sky image.
- Identifies optimal positions for multiple radio telescopes.

## Repository Structure

- **C Sources:**
  - process.c: Reads signal data, performs Hilbert transform (`hilbertTransform`).
  - client4.c & client5.c: Implement client routines for receiving data, performing FFT using AVX instructions (see fft_avx.c and fft_basic.c) and computing phase differences.
  - argmax.c & cumsum.c: Utility functions.
  - saver.c, server2.c, server2b.c: Additional signal processing and networking routines.
  
- **Notebooks:**
  - hilbert.ipynb & methods.ipynb: Demonstrate signal processing methods (Hilbert transform, FFT, cross-correlation). These notebooks also illustrate the use of **Torch** for GPU-accelerated tensor computations and **Numba** to optimize numerical Python code.

- **Build System:**
  - The build/ directory contains CMake configuration files.
  - The provided Makefile (see below) compiles the core C executables.

- **Libraries & Figures:**
  - **libtfhe/** and **tfhe/**: Contain supporting libraries.
  - **figs/**: Contains generated plots and images.

## Tools & Technologies

- **AVX:**  
  Many computationally intensive routines (like in fft_avx.c and client4.c) use AVX instructions for SIMD parallelism to accelerate vectorized math operations.

- **Torch:**  
  Used in Python notebooks (methods.ipynb) for fast, GPU-accelerated mathematical computing and simulations (e.g., computing sine functions on large tensors).

- **Numba:**  
  Applied to speed up Python numerical functions with just-in-time compilation, reducing runtime in signal processing algorithms.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Building the C Executables:**

   Open a terminal in the project root and run:
   
   ```sh
   make
